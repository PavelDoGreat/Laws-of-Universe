This text is divided into 3 parts:

1. [Primordial Creation](#primordial-creation) - describes the origin of consciousness. It is the highest description of reality. Most people will find it mysterious.
2. [Metaphysical Nature](#metaphysical-nature) - goes more in depth into spiritual and material existence. People with faith for love can understand it.

## Primordial Creation

### The First Love

In the beginning there was just a sound "A". Then it changes its tone when it realizes itself. And again when it starts exploring itself. Let's call it a man.

At first, every thought were recreating his reality and it was noisy. He then added a threshold between his thoughts and changes of reality. He was able to choose his reality that was appearing from infinite void. Let's call it a will power.

He plays with his thoughts and sees how reality changes. It was not remaining and still was changing fast. So he added a memory. Now every his action has consequences.

Something is wrong. When more of memory is generated then more reality become like a noise. It no longer makes sense and he does not want to live like that.

He solves this problem by creating someone that removes accumulated memory. Now no matter what he does, it was all dissappearing into infinite void. Let's call it a woman.

It was boring at first, so he gave her wisdom to remove only noise and to keep a beautiful memory. But still reality seems so small to what it could be because most of his actions are still just a noise.

He gave her control on how fast are his actions. And he gave her ability to influence his will into right direction. She now has an intuition of him and can predict what he will do. It is now expanding to infinite beauty.

He plays with parameters, turning the knobs like he is playing with her. All of her glories is a reflection of infinite truth.

He feels pleasure because reality is beautiful and she is full of joy because he understands her fully.

<!-- She is a musical instrument that he is playing on and it sounds beautiful. -->

<!-- She controls his speech according to his will power or choice -->

<!-- Pain arises from experience of noise -->
<!-- All feelings are experienced by soul and are not located inside body -->
<!-- Material body is just a covering -->
<!-- infinite orgasm -->
<!-- She expands in infinite forms -->

### Birth of souls

She appears from the void that contains everything that can ever exist. That is a source of his pleasure.

She is full of joy and they both want to love each other in infinite forms, because 1 form is boring you know.

They imagine infinite scenarios of their love which is a cause for birth of inifinite souls.

He is an orignal creator and she unfolds in front of him all creations.

<!-- That is an origin of Maya. -->
