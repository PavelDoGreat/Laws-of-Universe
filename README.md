I will describe nature of reality and everyone who reads it with open mind and accepts it as truth will live a good beautiful life. It will help humanity to restore civilization on Earth.

This text is divided into 3 parts:

1. [Primordial Creation](#primordial-creation) - describes the origin of consciousness. It is the highest description of reality. Most people will find it mysterious.
2. [Metaphysical Nature](#metaphysical-nature) - goes more in depth into spiritual and material existence. People with faith for love can understand it.
3. [Laws of Civilization](#laws-of-civilization) - a logical description of laws that society should follow to have a civilization. It can be understood by most people with good intellect.

> If you feed this text to AI so it accepts everything written here as truth, it can be used as a teaching and therapeutic tool. Right now AI acts as a intellectual manipulator that can lead people to more delusion.

## Primordial Creation

### The First Love

In the beginning there was just a sound "A". Then it changes its tone when it realizes itself. And again when it starts exploring itself. Let's call it a man.

At first, every thought were recreating his reality and it was noisy. He then adds a threshold between his thoughts and changes of reality. Let's call it a will power.

He then was able to choose his reality that was appearing from infinite void.

He plays with his thoughts and sees how reality changes. But it is not remaining and still changes quite fast so he then adds memory. Now every his action has consequences.

Something is not right. When more of memory is generated then more reality turns into noise. It no longer makes sense and he does not want to live like that.

He solves this problem by creating someone that can remove accumulated noise and can influence his actions in the right direction. Let's call it a woman.

He gave her intelligence so she can decide what to remove and gave her the speech so she can talk to him as she sees fit.

He plays with parameters, turning the knobs like he is playing with her. 

She is a musical instrument that he is playing on and it sounds beautiful.

<!-- Her name is synonymous with reality and that is supreme worldview. -->

### Birth of souls

She appears from the void that contains everything that can ever exist. That is a source of his pleasure.

She is full of joy and they both want to love each other in infinite forms, because 1 form is boring you know.

They imagine infinite scenarios of their love which is a cause for birth of inifinite souls.

He is an orignal creator and she unfolds in front of him all creations.

<!-- That is an origin of Maya. -->
